# WorldWide Telescope Tile Pyramid SDK

This document describes a process that can be used to create tiled image pyramids to be used with WorldWide Telescope. A sample implementation of the interfaces and methods is included, and if your source data matches this closely then the sample code provided should work in full or in part for the task. If there are significant differences between the source data used in the samples and the source data you have, then this document should be used to describe a template for implementing the appropriate interfaces and methods.
